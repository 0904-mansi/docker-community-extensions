Docker Extensions lets you use third-party tools within Docker Desktop to extend its functionality. 


## Why Developers need Docker Extension?
- Extensions allows developers to seamlessly connect their favorite development tools to your application development and deployment workflows. 
- Extension augments Docker Desktop with debugging, testing, security, and networking functionalities, and build custom add-ons using the Extensions SDK.
- Extensions open a realm of possibilities for developers by adding a variety of tools to your development workflows. 
- Developers can now leverage their favorite tools directly from within Docker Desktop with one-click installation of extensions. 
- Developers can now discover new ways to implement and optimize workflows in the Marketplace with extensions from both official Extension partners and community members.
